I created a web app to help students maintain organization, with the goal of having a central place where students can manage their schoolwork without having to switch between multiple platforms. It has similar functionality to apps like My Study Life, Trello, and myHomework, but it also allows for Canvas integration. This means that when students link their Canvas account, it will be able to display schedule, upcoming assignments, current grades, and more directly in the app while still allowing them to add their own assignments/tasks.
